AT&T vs INtel Syntax

<op> A, B

mov1 $1, %eax
addl (%ebx, %ecx, 0x2), %eax
subq 0x20(%rbx), %rax

Intel: A<-A <op> B
mov eax, 1 
add eax, [ebx+ecx*2h]
sub rax, [rbx+20h]

<op> 

- step by step values per operations
- 
- the first one is initializing
- the first valye moved to eas... then do the adding, then move
