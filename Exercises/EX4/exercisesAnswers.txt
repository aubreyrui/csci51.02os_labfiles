Exercise: Assembly File (cppAssembly2)
Note: the compiler runs in Mac Os
1. Code lines for each operation are as follows:
Addition: add	w8, w8, w9
Subtraction: subs	w8, w8, w9
Multiplication: mul	w8, w8, w9
Division: sdiv	w8, w8, w9
Modulo:
sdiv	w9, w8, w10
mul	    w9, w9, w10
subs	w8, w8, w9

2. What do you observe in the divide instruction?
I noticed that it called the sdiv insturction. "sdiv" performs a signed 32-bit division.

3. For the function call to dummy, what do you notice in terms of how the code puts the arguments on the stack?
